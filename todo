** fix Biped not being properly connected and disconnected from the map when doing physics.

-> implement damage
    -> projectile lifetime
    -> biped melee damage

-> implment sound
    -> looping sounds
    -> spatial aware sounds (3d listener)
    -> [extra] add "EAX" sound effects

-> fix biped movement
    -> not properly being connected/disconnected when doing physics
    -> need to implement handling multiple surface connections
    -> disable collision with certain object (weapons/bipeds)
    -> handle biped-biped collision properly

-> implement "point" collision for spherical/capsule collision

-> particle rendering or hs compiler work
    -> todo
